# Project Description
Soccer Social is a MERN stack app. It is a social network for fans and people who enjoy playing soccer.  Members of this social network will be able to:
Sign up, create a profile, and securely login to the social network
View other membersâ€™ profiles and share updates as well as add comments to other members updates.
Create meetups and post them for others. Other members can view meetups and join them.
Search for venues and save them to plan their future meetups. The app uses Google Maps for geolocation and Google Places APIs.
